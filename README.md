CSA Semester 1 Project Documentation
App Name: Community Helper 
Brief Description: Our app aims to display a calendar of events happening near you, a social media feed, conference videos, and the ability to report problems in your city. 
Group Names:
Latisha Sumardy, Hannah Edge, 
Arina Sobol, Camryn Lee

We want to provide a source where everyone in the city can access information and connect with each other virtually. The Community Organizer app will host a schedule of city events using the Google Calendar as well as integrating a bulletin-board styled file-upload/posting system. It will be an app where local citizens can submit possible civic improvements via Google Forms. Each citizen will be able to create a profile, which will contain their name, email, and other personal information. They would also be able to livestream city council meetings and contribute over Youtube Live. 

Proto.io Prototype

Initially, we planned to have several different screens. Our original plan was to have a calendar page, news page, community maps page, social wall page, repair request page, board member and conference meeting page, and a livestreaming page. However, we decided to eliminate the community maps, governing documents, and board members, and we are simplifying the calendar because peer reviewers suggested that our app may be too complicated. 
Class Design/Data Model, UML and Unit Testing
(UML Diagram displays initial plans for app, the classes for map, board members, and repair requests was eliminated)

Unit Testing: Because our application required no arithmetic, the only unit test involved was a default style JUnit test that tested to see if each method worked as needed.

Navigation
For the navigation portion of this assignment we are using a navigation drawer which is a panel on the left side of our app, or in the center, displaying the different screens that you could go to. We tried to simplify our interface, so it is less confusing and provides better functionality. Compared to our proto.io prototype, usability in this app should be improved.

Data Input
There is not that much data input that is in our app, there is more output than input. The few inputs we have is a login page, a post uploading system, and a google forms page.
Data Output
The data output that we achieved was the live streaming page, splash page, the feed, calendar page, and google forms. 

Unique Feature
Some unique features that were added into our app was a splash page, a neat calendar, and live Youtube Conference streaming. The Live youtube streaming was a great addition to what our app was intended to do. It connects to the youtube live API, and it displays the videos to provide users access to real-time meetings/conferences wherever they may be. The splash page is a loading screen. The calendar is an extra detail that displays events when clicked on the tab.

Project Summary
We all worked with a collaborative effort on this project. Some of us split up into partners to do separate fragments of the app such as the login screen, or the calendar. By splitting the parts we were able to work in the most efficient way possible. We were able to accomplish some of what we planned for. The groups that reviewed our app said it was confusing, and it needed to have less features. So, we got rid of the community maps, board members, and repair request pages. Then, we added the splash page which took a lot longer than expected. Overall the app works how we wanted it to work. The user interface is a bit different now because of the new navigation drawer. Not all of the fragments are fully functioning, but if we had more time, we would be able to complete all of the fragments. If we were to go back and make enhancements, we would find a way to simplify the interface, to make it less confusing. This could allow us to reintegrate the maps or other features that we eliminated.
